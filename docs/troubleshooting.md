# ‚ùì Troubleshooting

## API Key Issues
- **"Missing environment variables"**: Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root and contains the required API keys
- **"API key not valid"**: Check that you've copied the full key correctly with no extra spaces
- **"OpenRouter API error"**: Verify your OpenRouter API key is valid and has sufficient credits

## Connection Problems
- **"Cannot connect to API server"**: Make sure the API server is running on port 8001
- **"CORS error"**: The API is configured to allow all origins, but if you're having issues, try running both frontend and backend on the same machine

## Generation Issues
- **"Error generating wiki"**: For very large repositories, try a smaller one first
- **"Invalid repository format"**: Make sure you're using a valid GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket URL format
- **"Could not fetch repository structure"**: For private repositories, ensure you've entered a valid personal access token with appropriate permissions
- **"Diagram rendering error"**: The app will automatically try to fix broken diagrams

## Common Solutions
1. **Restart both servers**: Sometimes a simple restart fixes most issues
2. **Check console logs**: Open browser developer tools to see any JavaScript errors
3. **Check API logs**: Look at the terminal where the API is running for Python errors
