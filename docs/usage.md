# ðŸ¤– Ask & DeepResearch Features

## Ask Feature

The Ask feature allows you to chat with your repository using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):

- **Context-Aware Responses**: Get accurate answers based on the actual code in your repository
- **RAG-Powered**: The system retrieves relevant code snippets to provide grounded responses
- **Real-Time Streaming**: See responses as they're generated for a more interactive experience
- **Conversation History**: The system maintains context between questions for more coherent interactions

## DeepResearch Feature

DeepResearch takes repository analysis to the next level with a multi-turn research process:

- **In-Depth Investigation**: Thoroughly explores complex topics through multiple research iterations
- **Structured Process**: Follows a clear research plan with updates and a comprehensive conclusion
- **Automatic Continuation**: The AI automatically continues research until reaching a conclusion (up to 5 iterations)
- **Research Stages**:
  1. **Research Plan**: Outlines the approach and initial findings
  2. **Research Updates**: Builds on previous iterations with new insights
  3. **Final Conclusion**: Provides a comprehensive answer based on all iterations

To use DeepResearch, simply toggle the "Deep Research" switch in the Ask interface before submitting your question.
